# P03-Exceptional-Shopping-Cart
In this assignment, we are going to implement an enhanced version of the Shopping Cart (P01).
You are going to add the following features to our famous program:
• Throw exceptions to report bugs or misuse of a set of methods that we have already
implemented in P01.
• Load cart summary to the exceptional shopping cart from a file.
• Save the cart summary of the cart in a file too, with respect to a specific format.
• Develop unit tests to check the correctness of the implementation of the different operations
supported by our exceptional shopping cart.
The goals of this assignment include:
• Learn how to improve the robustness of a program so it can survive unusual circumstances
and cope with erroneous input without crashing.
• Develop your understanding of the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions,
and get practice both throwing and catching exceptions of each kind.
• Get more practice writing tests, specifically tests that detect whether exceptions are
thrown under the prescribed circumstances or not.
The source code can be found in the '' directory.
